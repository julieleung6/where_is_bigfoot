       "'I don\\'t know if I\\'m lucky or unlucky? I\\'ve had three run in\\'s with Bigfoot. My name is Steve I\\'m 40 years old, and I don\\'t really like to tell people about this. When you tell people, most in not so many words call you a liar! Or I don\\'t beleave that stuff! I\\'m sure a lot of you have experianced that. My first incident was a sighting, at night. My wife and kids and I were on county highway #21, headed back home to Babbitt from Virginia. On the curve just past the Wassa town hall road. The pasenger side high beam light had a broken mount. The light pointed to the oncomming traffic lane. As I was on the curve, I saw a very tall hairy creature walking accross the road. The bad headlight staid fixed on him as he crossed the road. I drive with one of my hands on top of the wheel, and this time it was my right hand. I pointed and tried to yell but nothing came out! Again I tried, still nothing! as it got into the ditch by a evergreen fall. I finnally was able to yell to my wife, \"did you see that!!\" She was playing a hand held yahtzee game. And she jumped in her seat when I yelled. I don\\'t remember what she said, but I know she asked me what I saw. I told her I saw Bigfoot. She later told me, that she beleaved me. I can still see this in my mind clear as a bell. For a long time now I\\'ve had recurring dreams about it, some are nightmares. The second incident was again at night but only about an hour after sunset. It was durring deer season, my eldest son and I were tracking a wounded deer. It was getting dark so we decided to give up for the night. As we were leaving, One of my hunting partners showed up. He said we should give it another shot, maybe we\\'ll get lucky. So the three of us walked together on a road that went in a big circle. We got about half way through and we split up. My son went with my partner, and I doubled back. I was about 200 yrds. from the cars, and I thought I heard a grunt. I stopped and then I heard what sounded like a  tree being broken off at the base. Then a loud grunt and a tree hitting brush and the ground toward me. I loaded the gun with the clip so fast! grabbed the fore stock with flashlight in hand and litterally walked in little circle\\'s all 200 yrd\\'s. to the cars. when I got there, my partner and my son arrived. I told my partner \"he\\'s here!\". He replied I know did you find him? I said not the deer HE\\'S HERE!! Know way where? I said up the hill on the raod, and he through a tree at me!!!! We talked for a while and we went home. I didn\\'t go on that road for the rest of the season. The next year, I had to know. So I went back and found the tree, the tree trunk and it had been thrown about 25 feet. It stopped up against another tree. I can show you where to this day! Last but not least. Last week my son and I found a footprint. I casted it and have it at home.'"

       "TextBlob(\"I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky? I've had three run in's with Bigfoot. By name is Steve I'm 40 years old, and I don't really like to tell people about this. When you tell people, most in not so many words call you a liar! Or I don't leave that stuff! I'm sure a lot of you have experienced that. By first incident was a fighting, at night. By wife and kiss and I were on county highway #21, headed back home to Rabbit from Virginia. In the curve just past the Pass town hall road. The passenger side high beam light had a broken mount. The light pointed to the oncoming traffic lane. Is I was on the curve, I saw a very tall hairy creature walking across the road. The bad headlight staid fixed on him as he crossed the road. I drive with one of my hands on top of the wheel, and this time it was my right hand. I pointed and tried to yell but nothing came out! Again I tried, still nothing! as it got into the ditch by a evergreen fall. I finally was able to yell to my wife, \"did you see that!!\" The was playing a hand held yahtzee game. And she jumped in her seat when I yelled. I don't remember what she said, but I know she asked me what I saw. I told her I saw Bigfoot. The later told me, that she believed me. I can still see this in my mind clear as a bell. For a long time now I've had recurring dreams about it, some are nightmare. The second incident was again at night but only about an hour after sunset. It was during deer season, my eldest son and I were cracking a wounded deer. It was getting dark so we decided to give up for the night. Is we were leaving, One of my hunting partners showed up. He said we should give it another shot, maybe we'll get lucky. To the three of us walked together on a road that went in a big circle. He got about half way through and we split up. By son went with my partner, and I doubled back. I was about 200 yards. from the cars, and I thought I heard a grunt. I stopped and then I heard what sounded like a  tree being broken off at the base. When a loud grunt and a tree hitting brush and the ground toward me. I loaded the gun with the clip so fast! grabbed the fore stock with flashlight in hand and literally walked in little circle's all 200 yard's. to the cars. when I got there, my partner and my son arrived. I told my partner \"he's here!\". He replied I know did you find him? I said not the deer of'S HERE!! Now way where? I said up the hill on the road, and he through a tree at me!!!! He talked for a while and we went home. I didn't go on that road for the rest of the season. The next year, I had to know. To I went back and found the tree, the tree trunk and it had been thrown about 25 feet. It stopped up against another tree. I can show you where to this day! Last but not least. Last week my son and I found a footprints. I lasted it and have it at home.\")"

       "\"This is an update on an original sighting reported in 1995. I am a researcher and have been following up on this. Below is the response I recieved from the NYS DEC investigator assigned to the original incident. Also enclosed is the original Corning Leader newspaper report on the incident. I am continuing my efforts to track down the hair samples and obtain photos of the original footprint casts taken by the NYS DEC. Marty Wilson *********************** Subj:    Re: Bigfoot in Rathbone? Date:    7/10/02 11:02:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time From:    jafodge@gw.dec.state.ny.us (James Fodge) To:    CaptainNya@aol.com  Your recent request for information about the Addison Big Foot was forwarded to me. I was the one who investigated this. In my 30 years working for the Bureau of Wildlife I have been called on to investigate some very strange things, all of which were explainable in one way or another. This was the exception. I have to agree with the newspaper statement that if this was a hoax, it was a beauty. I was kind of hoping Bigfoot would show up again, but no such luck. The best hope of solving this was the hair-like material we found at the site and subsequently sent to Cornell. I never got an official report back but I did hear that it was never identified. I guess we'll just have to wait for it to show up again. Jim Fodge ******************** >>>\""

       "'We have had several encounters with this creature. We used to have it living in the back of our woods near the swamp, but since clearing of land further back from other neighbors, it has moved to the other side of the forest. It still frequents the area. Run-ins still occur and have now for years. And now, there is a young with the mother. I really do not know what to say but the most important thing to me is trying to protect this animal, aka Bigfoot. This creature has not harmed anyone, is shy, but is really not afraid of people. I am hoping that someone here will help me out in determining the next step I could take. I DO NOT WANT THIS ANIMAL TO BE HARMED IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE OR REMOVED FROM ITS HABITAT. IT IS NOT A THREAT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING!! There have been too many occasions to name that just proved to me and others that we have a family living close by. Seen, heard, smelled, footprints, etc. I would like to somehow get help from the govenment to protect this creature so no harm could come to it from anyone and that no one would try to hunt it down just for the money and fame. That is the only reason I am not giving the location of where all this is occurring. I am a registered nurse. I care about my job and reputation but I would rather have a \"rep of being crazy\" than ever having any harm done to this creature. Please respond with some help to point me in the right direction to help secure this animal\\'s well-being and safety. Please. Thank you for your time and I await anxiously for your response.'"

    "merged_df[merged_df['OBSERVED'] == 'The following incidents occurred between the years 1984 and 1986 around our woods which is located just south of the intersection of E300 N Rd 300 and county road 1425 Northwest of Atwood Illinois. At the time we lived in the 15 acre woods which is at that location. The Lake fork river runs just behind that woods and there is a bottom land just north of the woods which floods every fall. At the time I was a teenager and hunted, fished and trapped along a several mile stretch of that river. The encounters we had were not visual. The first instance was about 10pm on a winter evening when I was going to let our poodle out before turning in for the night. There was only what I could describe as a combination of a Scream/howl which came from just on the North side of the house. Our dog was so frightened it would not go out of the door. He was not afraid of anything and to see that fear in him was shocking. The volume of the howl was immense. My mother was home and heard it as well. Even from inside a well insulated Illinois home it sounded as if it was right next to you. I had the door open and it felt like I had been hit in the chest by the sound. The second instance was just south of that woods about a half mile down from where the river bends. I was returning from hunting about 5pm in the evening and heard the exact same howl. It came from the smaller wood which is right next to the river just south of our woods. The 3rd instance was a series of footprints along the bank of the lake fork river. Just to the west of the road intersection mentioned above, the lake fork passes under a bridge. Just south of that bridge the river bends and flows east. I was fishing along that bend on a spring day about 10 in the morning. I felt that there was something not right and then realized that there were no animal sounds. Typically there are all sorts of sparrows and red winged black birds, but there was nothing. I looked down as I was walking and noticed that I was walking next to a line of footprints in the mud. I wore mens size 12 hiking boots and these prints were 5 toed and 2\" wider and 3\" longer than my boots. They were very fresh with dirt still loose on the edge of the track. I looked up and down the river but did not see a thing. The river banks in that area are steep with tall grass. The forth instance was while deer hunting on the east side of the large woods just to the north east of that bridge. I had gone out bow hunting and had set up a blind on the east side of the woods. I had walked from our house and was set up in a blind in full camo by 45mins prior to sunrise. Just before light I heard the same howl which I estimated came from about 50 yards away to my north. It was so powerful that it shook me. I waited for several minutes and it howled again. Only having a bow and not a gun I literally walked backwards the few hundred yards back to the county road with an arrow knocked and ready to go. Not that it would have done any good. You could tell by the volume of the scream/howl that this was a very very large creature. The 5th instance was around 10:30 at night in the back of our house. We kept a large horse tank in the back where we would dump and burn trash. It was approximately 35 yards behind the house. I was taking the trash out and had just dumped it when I heard a \"Hmph\" from the edge of the tree line which was about 10 yards away. I head another \"Hmph\" and then something large taking off down the side of the hill towords the bottom land, I headed quickly in the house. The next morning I checked the area and could see the same size prints mentioned above. I couldn\\'t see them clearly as before due to thick ground cover of leaves. The Howls around our house were heard by my mother. I do not know of any other people in the area having the same instances. at the time there were only 4 families living in that area. Us, my uncle who lived across the river, a family that lived in the house by the bridge and another that lived just east of the road intersection mentioned above.']"
